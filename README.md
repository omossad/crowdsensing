# Crowdsensing in Cognitive Radio Networks
#
This repository provides the source code for the **Wimob 18'** paper titled: [Genetic Algorithm-based Crowdsensing for Cognitive Radio Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8589174).  
We used [**DEAP**](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library to implement the **Genetic Algorithm**.  
> **Note:** The code currently provides the scenario where the number of users is **120** and the number of locations **40**. For evaluations we performed multiple runs while varying the number of users and locations..
